        <h1>Employment</h1>
        <p>We are always looking for new talent to come work for us at the thrift store. If you care about community, have a dedicated mindset, and need a job then come apply today! All you have to bring is yourself (but a resum&eacute certainly helps!). You can either call ahead to set up an interview or you can show up and knock on the office in the back. Either way is fine with us!</p>
        <p>There is no need to show up in a suit or dress either. We prefer a more casual environment (but not pyjama casual!) in our store. Wear comfortable clothing and be professional and you just might join our hard-working team!</p>
